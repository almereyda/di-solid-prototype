# AWS elements needed to run ESS in Kubernetes

To save time in building our protoype we're going to run ESS in the Kubernetes cluster we built 
to demo the hello world app because that cluster already has lots of useful things set up like 
access controls, `kubectl` etc.

This folder contains any additional AWS elements that are needed for ESS.
